After a snack, children can relax and have fun after a busy day at school. They have access to a wide range of activities: various games, painting and drawing, yoga and relaxation, gardening and DIY activities, to name but a few. All activities are designed to be enriching and creative respecting the child’s rhythm and needs.

Workshops take place in our own very [Lab](https://www.google.fr/maps?q=77+rue+de+la+tullaye+nantes&rlz=1C1JZAP_enFR710FR711&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL6Pi9jd_cAhULCxoKHZXoAKEQ_AUICigB), a place entirely designed for kids, in the middle of a garden. It has a real home feel, which help children feel comfortable quickly and help them express themselves with ease. Workshops are carried out in small groups and with children of similar ages.   

> We can come and pick up kids from schools located in the neighbourhood of **Rond-point de Paris**. We are currently working on creating groups of kids of similar ages (3 to 4 and 5 to 6); please contact us f you want to have more information on the programme, know the names of the schools we work with in the neighbourhood and enrol your child(ren) for the next school year. We look forward to hearing from you!
