Through feeling and touching objects, making things, moving around and singing songs… Toddlers develop all their senses through fun and physical activities carried out entirely in English.

Each workshop is based on a specific theme that kids get to explore via a different range of sensorial activities. Themes are directly related to children’s day-to-day activities and linked to their interests. We use an active learning pedagogy and various teaching materials.

Workshops take place on a weekly basis at [Happy Place by Vacouva](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Vacouva/@47.2146419,-1.5433538,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4805eeb8399276c5:0xe54ac076a5ce2080!8m2!3d47.2146419!4d-1.5411651) (Gare Sud neighbourhood), with several slots being available throughout the week.

Workshops are carried out by Cecilia, our linguist. Discover her profile [here](/en/team). 

> We also work with kindergartens and preschools; please [get in touch](/en/contact-us) with us directly if you want to discuss your project.
