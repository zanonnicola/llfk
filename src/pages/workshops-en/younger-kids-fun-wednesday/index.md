On Wednesday, children meet at our [Lab](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/77+Rue+de+la+Tullaye,+44300+Nantes/@47.2344978,-1.5400865,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4805eef2f55178b9:0xb8d682b0e8e29b0e!8m2!3d47.2344978!4d-1.5378978) for a moment of fun discoveries and experimentation: fine arts, DIY, STEM experiences, cooking, gardening… all in English of course! For kids, it’s also an opportunity to have a bit of a break in the middle of the week, be in an environment that is different from school and feels a little bit more like home. They get to try out and discover new disciplines while learning a lot of new things.
