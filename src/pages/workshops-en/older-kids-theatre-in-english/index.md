Learning a language is about living it and speaking it with other people… simply! With theatre, learning English is part of the play: kids act out daily life situations, theatre sketches and cinema plays that they know or can relate to or do role plays or some improv. Children enjoy speaking English, while developing confidence in themselves, accepting and respecting others and learning how to work as part of a team. 

Theatre workshops take place at L’Open Lab’s very own Lab, a place entirely designed for children, located at the back of a garden, away from prying eyes… A perfect environment for learning and accepting to let it go!
