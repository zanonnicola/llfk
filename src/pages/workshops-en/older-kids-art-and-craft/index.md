Colouring, painting, cutting, creating… We believe that to learn a language you need to really live it beyond learning from books. Children develop their creativity through discovering fine arts. They learn and improve their English in a practical and fun way. Workshops are hosted by [Tatiana](/en/team), our Fine Arts Teacher, at [Happy Place by Vacouva](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Vacouva/@47.2147032,-1.5433222,17z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x4805eeb84753995d:0xb3771b6433584ec0!2s43+Quai+de+Malakoff,+44000+Nantes!3b1!8m2!3d47.2147032!4d-1.5411335!3m4!1s0x4805eeb8399276c5:0xe54ac076a5ce2080!8m2!3d47.2146419!4d-1.5411651) (Gare Sud neighbourhood).
