On Wednesday, children meet at our Lab for a moment of fun discovery and experimentation: fine arts, DIY, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) projects, cooking, gardening… and all through English of course! For kids, it’s also an opportunity to have a bit of a break in the middle of the week, be in an environment that is different from school and feels a little bit more like home. Children get to try out and discover new disciplines while learning a lot of new things.

> Interested in the Fun Wednesday workshop but not available on Wednesday morning? Please [get in touch with us](/en/contact-us), we're in the process of creating the groups and may be able to open a new workshop on that day.
