To feel and touch objects, making things, moving around and singing songs… Toddlers develop their senses through fun and physical activities carried out in English only.

Each workshop is based on a specific theme that kids get to explore via a different range of sensorial activities. Themes are directly related to children’s day-to-day activities and linked to their interests. We use an active learning pedagogy and various teaching materials.

Workshops take place on a weekly basis at Happy Place by Vacouva (Gare Sud neighbourhood), with several slots being available throughout the week.

Workshops are carried out by Cecilia, our linguist. Discover her profile [here](/en/team). For more information on our methodology, please [click here](/en/pedagogy).
