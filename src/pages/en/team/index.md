We have a team of native English-speaking teachers and bilingual professionals qualified in their area of expertise. 

We are all university degree level professionals and parents ourselves, with experience with babies and children. Just like Lâ€™Open Lab for Kids, the team is international and multicultural: English, Irish, American, Brazilian and French.

You will soon discover here all the members of our team.
